Module Name:

    GraphImpl2.c

Abstract:

    This module is our second implementation of graph innards for the CHM
    algorithm of the perfect hash library.  It implements GraphAssign2(),
    which is a more efficient implementation of the graph assignment step
    present in GraphImpl1.c, inspired by NetBSD's nbperf utility.

    I've included the copyright from NetBSD nbperf's nbperf-chm.c* for this
    reason; thanks Joerg Sonnenberger <joerg at bec dot de>!

Routine Description:

    This routine is called after a graph has determined to be acyclic.  It is
    responsible for walking the graph and assigning values to edges in order to
    complete the perfect hash solution.

Arguments:

    Graph - Supplies a pointer to the graph to operate on.

Return Value:

    None.
