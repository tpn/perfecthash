# IOCP Logs

## 2026-01-19
- Added IOCP context/server/client interfaces and COM scaffolding.
- Added NUMA-aware IOCP runtime skeleton (per-node IOCPs, worker threads with affinity).
- Wired new components into PerfectHash constants/build definitions.
- Added server/client executables with basic CLI parsing and IOCP startup wiring.
- Fixed /Wall padding warnings and confirmed Debug builds for server/client targets.
- Implemented named-pipe IOCP transport in the server with per-node pipe instances and a request/response state machine.
- Implemented client-side named-pipe connect and request submission with wire protocol headers.
- Fixed /Wall issues in new IOCP code (Rtl-backed ZeroMemory usage, struct padding, enum exhaustiveness) and rebuilt server/client executables.
- Wired server request dispatch to parse command-line payloads and call IOCP context bulk/table create entrypoints.
- Implemented IOCP ArgvW entrypoints by delegating to legacy PerfectHashContext workflows.
- Added server endpoint/local-only API + CLI configuration, plus error-response payload handling and client-side retrieval/printing.
- Added a PowerShell smoke test script for server/client shutdown round-trips.
- Ran `scripts/iocp-smoke.ps1` after fixes to confirm clean startup/shutdown.
- Diagnosed a Debug breakpoint during table create to a TLS global-component bitfield mismatch; realigned TLS flag bit positions to interface IDs and removed fragile asserts.
- Added a create-exe unhandled-exception stack trace hook (DbgHelp) to aid future diagnostics.
- Hardened `scripts/iocp-smoke.ps1` to handle missing exit codes after timed waits; smoke test now completes successfully.
- Added IOCP work item header/signature and per-item completion dispatch in the IOCP worker loop.
- Updated server pipe handling to use per-pipe IOCP work items instead of global completion callbacks.
- Added stress scripts for sys32 bulk create (direct and IOCP variants).
- Rebuilt PerfectHashServerExe and reran `scripts/iocp-smoke.ps1` successfully.
- Added bulk-create directory server request with per-request completion token (event + mapping).
- Implemented server-side directory walk and per-file IOCP work item dispatch for bulk requests.
- Added client-side `--BulkCreateDirectory` support with token wait and bulk result handling.
- Fixed bulk enqueue completion accounting and failure handling to avoid double-decrement.
- Updated IOCP sys32 stress script to use bulk-create directory request.
- Regenerated PerfectHash error headers/resources for new status codes.
- Rebuilt PerfectHashServerExe/PerfectHashClientExe with `/p:CL_MPCount=1` and reran `scripts/iocp-smoke.ps1`.
- Built Release targets for PerfectHashBulkCreate/Server/Client with `/p:CL_MPCount=1`.
- BulkCreate Release sys32 run at concurrency 32 crashed (`0xC0000005`); repeated `FlushConsoleInputBuffer` errors observed.
- BulkCreateDirectory argv handling fixed to always inject a program name for parsing.
- IOCP Release sys32 run at concurrency 32 fails with `SetThreadpoolThreadMinimum` access denied during per-file context init.
- Created `D:\\src\\perfecthash-main` worktree, built Release `PerfectHashBulkCreate.exe` and tested baseline bulk-create.
- `hard2` run succeeded but printed repeated `FlushConsoleInputBuffer` errors.
- `sys32` run crashed with access violation (`0xC0000005`) and the same flush errors, indicating the crash exists on `main`.

## 2026-01-20
- Rebased `iocp-dev` onto `origin/main` and resolved `PerfectHashBulkCreateExe.c` conflict by keeping upstream minidump handler.
- Ignored `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` from `SetMaximumConcurrency` in IOCP per-file work items to allow bulk runs to continue.
- Diagnosed IOCP bulk-create server crash (`0xC0000005`) to use-after-free of `CommandLineToArgvW` buffers referenced by table-create parameters.
- Retained bulk-create directory `ArgvW` buffers in request state (free on completion) and moved argv adjustment into server dispatch to keep string pointers alive.
- Fixed IOCP bulk work-item callback use-after-free (request freed before work item allocator cleanup).
- Mapped IOCP bulk-create crash to `PrepareCHeaderFileChm01` using `Context->CommandLineW`; crash was NULL due to direct `TableCreate` usage.
- Preserved request command line and seeded per-file contexts with `Context->CommandLineW` to keep header generation stable.
- Updated IOCP stress script to accept `PH_S_SERVER_BULK_CREATE_ALL_SUCCEEDED` as a success exit code.
- Ran `scripts/stress-sys32-iocp.ps1` against a single-file keys dir (Release, max concurrency 1); completed successfully.
- Added IOCP-backed file work dispatch hooks: context submit/wait helpers with outstanding-event tracking, per-file context IOCP port wiring, and file-work event signaling for non-threadpool callbacks.
- Added async work framework scaffolding and CHM01 async state machine skeleton (new modules, build integration).
- Added CHM01 async bridge that runs the legacy CHM01 routine on a worker thread and polls completion via IOCP, plus an env-gated async entrypoint.
- Replaced the CHM01 async bridge with IOCP-driven solver slices, graph work items, and a state-machine finalize path for save/close/verify.
- Fixed CHM01 async header macro usage inside a struct (removed extra semicolons) and prevented double-include macro expansion by adding `#pragma once` to `Chm01FileWork.h`.
- Added explicit padding to CHM01 async graph work items and undefed `EXPAND_AS_CHECK_ERRORS` before redefining to satisfy `/Wall` with warnings-as-errors.
- Rebuilt `PerfectHashServerExe` Debug successfully after the async/header fixes.
- Ran `scripts/stress-sys32-iocp.ps1` with `PERFECT_HASH_IOCP_ASYNC_CHM01=1` against `perfecthash-keys\\hard` (Debug, max concurrency 32); run timed out with client hung waiting for completion (server already exited), leaving partial output in `build-win\\iocp-stress-hard`.
- Added IOCP work-item flags and a CHM01 async pump loop so IOCP completions continue while `Chm01AsyncWaitJob()` waits; file work/async/pipe items are dispatched inline, bulk work items are requeued.
- Added a CHM01 async prepare-wait state for the try-larger-table-size path (still returns `PH_E_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` but now waits for prepare file work before closing).
- Stress runs against `perfecthash-keys\\hard` still time out; observed repeated `SetEndOfFile`/`PerfectHashFileTruncate` failures (error 1224: mapped section open) and `PrepareFileChm01` failures during IOCP bulk runs.
- Added a context flag to skip context-level file work for per-file IOCP contexts; CHM01 async prepare/save/close now bypass context file items and signal events directly to avoid `ERROR_USER_MAPPED_FILE` conflicts.
- Added `CHM01_ASYNC_JOB_FLAG_SAVE_SUBMITTED` and gated `Chm01AsyncFinalizeClose()` on save completion; updated graph completion to use `Job->Context` and the IOCP pump to wait for `Outstanding == 0` before exiting.
- IOCP stress runs still time out within the 120s tool limit, but bulk create AVs in `Chm01AsyncGraphStep` are no longer reproduced.
- Added per-work-item `LastError` tracking in IOCP bulk logging (`PerfectHashServerBulkCreateFailures.log`) to capture `GetLastError()` at the point of failure.
- Added focused two-file IOCP stress run directory (`build-win\\keys-test`) to isolate failures on `shell32-13803.keys`/`CoreUIComponents-7995.keys`.
- `Mulshrolate4X` is not recognized by `PerfectHashClient` (invalid hash function ID); only `Mulshrolate4RX` exists in current hash table list.
- IOCP bulk-create against the two-file `build-win\\keys-test` set with `Mulshrolate4RX` still hangs (client/server left running until manually terminated; no bulk failure log emitted).
- Normal `PerfectHashBulkCreate.exe` run on the same two-file set with `Mulshrolate4RX` crashed with `0xC0000005` after `CoreUIComponents-7995.keys`; no crash dump/log emitted.
- OG `PerfectHashBulkCreate.exe` run against `perfecthash-keys\\test1` (5 files) crashed with `0xC0000005` after `Hydrogen-43013.keys` even with an absolute output directory; `--DisableCsvOutputFile` did not prevent the crash; no crash dump/log emitted.

## 2026-01-21
- Created a clean `D:\\src\\perfecthash-main-clean` worktree at `origin/main` (7c83dc5a), built Debug `PerfectHashBulkCreateExe`, and ran `PerfectHashBulkCreate.exe` against `..\\perfecthash-keys\\test1` with `Chm01 Mulshrolate4RX And 4`; completed successfully with five output directories, indicating the crash is specific to `iocp-dev`.
- Noted that `tests/CMakeLists.txt` includes a bulk CLI test that uses `--NoFileIo` and `MultiplyShiftR`, so it doesn't cover the current file-I/O crash scenario.
- Clean rebuilt `build-win` after `PERFECT_HASH_CONTEXT` layout changes; `PerfectHashBulkCreate.exe` no longer AVs on `test1`, indicating a stale PCH/obj mismatch was responsible.
- Added crash-dir env overrides (`PH_BULK_CREATE_CRASH_DIR`, `PH_SERVER_CRASH_DIR`) and server crash test env (`PH_SERVER_CRASH_TEST`), plus DbgHelp preloading and `MiniDumpIgnoreInaccessibleMemory`.
- Reworked crash-test path to generate dumps without exception pointers (avoid `MiniDumpWriteDump` 998) and added `scripts/test-minidump.ps1`; Debug run now produces non-empty minidumps for bulk-create and server.
- Added a `MiniDumpWriteDump` retry path that drops exception pointers on `ERROR_NOACCESS`, keeping real-crash logs while allowing dumps to be written.
- Removed CHM01 async resize/try-larger-table logic (events, state transitions, and initial resize setup) to keep IOCP async solving focused on single-pass solve behavior.
- IOCP bulk stress against `perfecthash-keys\\hard` (Debug) still times out in ~120s; server left running and only ~12/23 output dirs created, indicating completion/hang persists post-resize removal.
- Attached `cdb` to `PerfectHashServer.exe` ~10s into a Debug IOCP bulk run and captured `~* kb` (`cdb-hard-backtrace.log`): main thread blocked in `PerfectHashServerWait`, IOCP worker threads blocked in `GetQueuedCompletionStatus` (33 waits on one IOCP handle, 24 on another), and ~1539 threads waiting in `ZwWaitForWorkViaWorkerFactory`, indicating no active IOCP completions at capture time and unexpected threadpool worker proliferation.
- Added IOCP-native argument extraction helpers (`PerfectHashContextIocpArgs.c`) and wired into build files.
- Added TLS flag plumbing for threadpool-less context creation and IOCP helper to create contexts with `CreateContextWithoutThreadpool` set.
- Updated server bulk/table create to avoid legacy context parsing and use IOCP-native arg extraction.
- Added IOCP table-create dispatch in server (context creation, file-work IOCP wiring, hook/RNG init, TLS context) and removed threadpool priority application.
- Routed server BulkCreate requests through the bulk-create directory path to avoid legacy context invocation.
- Clean rebuild (Debug) succeeded; IOCP stress on `perfecthash-keys\\hard` with `Mulshrolate4RX` and concurrency 32 timed out in ~330s; 23/23 output directories were created but the client hung waiting for completion, then was terminated.
- Debugger run with cdb breakpoints (`cdb-server-bp5.log`, `cdb-client-bp5.log`) showed client hits `PerfectHashClientWaitForBulkCreateToken`/`WaitForSingleObject`, server hits `PerfectHashServerBulkCreateWorkItemCallback`, but `PerfectHashServerCompleteBulkRequest` never hit within 120s; only 9 work-item callbacks logged and 5/23 output dirs created before termination.
- Debugger run against `perfecthash-keys\\test1` (5 files) showed `PerfectHashServerBulkCreateWorkItemCallback` hit 3 times, `PerfectHashServerCompleteBulkRequest` never hit, and only 1 output dir created (`cdb-server-bp-test1.log`, `cdb-client-bp-test1.log`).
- Repeated test1 run with server `--MaxConcurrency=1` showed only 1 work-item callback hit, no bulk completion, and 1 output dir created (`cdb-server-bp-test1-1.log`, `cdb-client-bp-test1-1.log`).
- Added cdb request-state logging using struct offsets from `cdb-types.log`. On test1, `PerfectHashServerEnqueueBulkRequest` hit once, and three work-item callbacks logged `TotalWorkItems=5` with `OutstandingWorkItems` at 2/4/6 and `DispatchComplete=0` at callback entry. `PerfectHashServerCompleteBulkRequest` never hit and only 1 output dir was created (`cdb-server-bp-test1-B.log`, `cdb-client-bp-test1-B.log`).
- `--NoFileIo` test (test1) under cdb: enqueue hit once, two work-item callbacks observed, no bulk completion hit, and no output directories created (`cdb-server-bp-test1-nofile.log`, `cdb-client-bp-test1-nofile.log`).
- Diagnosed `TpIsTimerSet` invalid-parameter crash in IOCP worker threads to `SubmitThreadpoolWork(Context->FinishedWork)` from `GraphSolve`; guarded finished-work submissions in `Graph.c`/`GraphCu.c` when threadpool init is skipped.
- Rebuilt Debug and reran IOCP bulk create on `perfecthash-keys\\test1` under cdb with breakpoints on `Chm01AsyncGraphComplete` and `PerfectHashServerCompleteBulkRequest`; graph completion fired repeatedly, bulk completion callback fired once, and all five output directories were created (`cdb-server-graphcomplete.log`).
- Re-ran IOCP bulk create on `perfecthash-keys\\test1` without cdb (`PERFECT_HASH_IOCP_ASYNC_CHM01=1`); completed successfully and emitted all five output directories (`build-win\\iocp-stress-test1-nocdb`).
